// Re-factor 

// first figure out how to properly display a project 

// change the add project btn that when clicked it will transform into an input form 

// hidden classes and onclick toggle a function which hides the btn and replaces it with something? An input field?

// add and remove classes depending on what the user 

import "./eventListenerModule";

import "./domLogic";

import "./conditionalLogic";

import "./arrayStorage"; 

// import "./style.scss";

// work on how you can, hide and show elements in JS depending on btn click, 

// I think you may need to make a elements in html, hide them, then call the element you want based

// upon a btn click, 

// hidden class can work, 

// next try to make an element visable when the add project btn is clicked, 

// add an input field, to the projects container, when the user clicks the add project

// Ok so when we click on the add project btn 

// it will hide the add project btn, 

// it will show an input field with an + btn, 

// now work on when the user clicks out of it, 

// it will bring back the add project btn, 

// wanted to find a way that when the input field is open and the user clicks away from it, it will bring back the +add project btn 

// and close the input field. 



// well now it seems like I need to make a pop-up field, to add the project name, 

// follow along on how to make a pop-up field, that includes an input field, 

// get value from input field, 

// pass the value to storage into an obj, and also into local storage 

// figure out how to make a function that displays the contents of the storage, to the DOM. 



// making the modal 

// btn can be used how you did with library, keep moving










// now you need to consider how your project names are going to be added to the main content section 

// the names are added to the projects section, 

// once clicked they shall be added to the main content container, 

// if you click on the project name in the main content section, the to do form should pop-up, 

// remember one input form at a time, you may have to disable the btn and re-enable the btn, 

// before moving on I would also check, and review your current code, remove commented out code that does nothing but take up space \

// check the names of the variables and functions, make sure it makes sense to you, better to do it now, check it out 

// partially have the logic, that generates input field, 

// try to seperate the logic, grab this element projectNameElementProjectSection 

// grab the element add a listener to it, perform the conditional logic inside there, 

// then call the DOM module to begin adding it's properties.  

// hello everyone, running into a small problem with to do, 

// overall trying to keep my DOM logic and event listeners in seperate modules 

// I am trying to access the project name element from the DOM module 

// I am exporting the function that contains the variable, 

// then importing it but when I try to access the element in the listener module, 

// using ID, class, query selector, I jsut get undefined back, 

// I'm really not sure why this is happening, I have not ran into this issue yet, 

// importing and exporting and using functions/variables from other modules seemed very straightforward, 

// I would just work on the function in the meantime, keeping everything within the same file, 

// work on issue on clicking project name in projects section 

// it should not append multiple btns. 

// that will cause issues 

// well thinking generally, similar to the previous issue, 

// I need to somehow disable the btn/name of the element, after it has been clicked 

// so the user cannot add another btn, 

// prevent the user from adding another btn, after clicking the btn, 

// If the user value matches what is already in the main content section 


// first work on the btn appending issue, if the user clicks the project name again, 

// it will keep adding btn's, don't add more btn's 

// don't add the project again, if it already EXISTS IN THE MAIN CONTAINER 

// NOW TOGGLING BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN TWO PROJECTS 

// YOU ARE SIMPLYING REPLACING THE PROJECT WITHIN THE CONTAINER, 

// ONLY ONE PROJECT CAN BE SHOWN IN THE CONTAINER, 

// the conditional to stop appending multiple projet's to the main content section, 

// the conditional will check if that project element already exists in the main content section, 


// the problem seems to be the buttons appending, I need to find a way to prevent the btn's from keeping on appending, 

// if the btn already exists the main container, then don't append, or disable, hide, or remove element 

// I am running into some many problems with to do list, 

// I am trying to keep things in modules and keep the logic/event listeners seperate from the DOM Logic, 

// I want access to the project name element within the event listener, 

// so if the user clicks the project in the little sidebar it gets appended to the DOM, 

// well right now I am performing DOM stuff with event listeners, 

// but that element is only available when the btn is clicked, 

// I guess my question is can I keep my current logic, within my DOM module? 

// The problem is that I want to access a particular but that element is created within a listener, 

// basically the user enters name of project presses add btn, the value gets passed to a function which creates the DOM element 

// such as appending to the projects section and the main content section, 



// Running into a lot of problems with to do 

// basically I want to access an element in a different module 

// problem is that element is dynamically created within an event listener, 

// I would like to keep my DOM and logic stuff seperate, 

// currently I grabbed the element in the DOM module, and added an event listener to it, 

// now I have to use logic, to make sure the user cannot keep adding the same btn to the DOM based on btn click, 

// basically my question is my current domLogic module ok? Adding an event listener and logic within the dom module 

// It does not seem right but I don't see any other way to do this. 

// how can I stop the add -todo btns from appending upon each button click? 

// everything is attached within event listeners, 

// click add project btn form is generated, add btn is pressed value is saved 

// that value is passed to another function, well the function is called then, 

// can we call the function at a different time, why? 

// shouldnt it be passed and called as soon as you get value? 

// can I just create another function, 

// one that stores the user value, 

// one that returns the user value appended to the DOM? 

// you pass the value to another function, 

// that function returns that userValue appended to the DOM/containers 

// capture it;s return value from another function, 

// add an event listener to that function, 

// so lets try to make another function 1 that takes the value and appends to container, DOM 

// I will now try to add the calender option to my todo form 

// another which takes that function above and adds a listener to it, using the logic inside . 

// expierment working with two functions, saving one function to variable, adding the DOM stuff return a value, 

// take that function expression add a listener to it. 

// well the problem is that every time I click the add project btn 

// it will keep appending more add-todo btns to the DOM, 

// because when the form pops up 

// and the user hits the add btn, 

// the function that handles DOM is called, 

// is there a way I can isolate the project section name element? 

// well what I was thinking of yesterday, 

// is can I make a seperate function? 

// can that function store a variable? userValue? 

// then can that function be called? 

// I'm not even sure what the hell to even do 

// that function is being called within the listener, 

// so every time you click that btn or project name, it will keep making btns 

// determine when it's time to append to the DOM ?

// one function to store value 

// one function to take/access that value and then append to DOM 

// store the value, the function can be called there, 



// How can I stop the user from adding multiple btn's when user clicks on project? 

// the problem seems that I'm calling the function which does that within an event listener, 

// but where else can I call it? 

// Is there a way around this or do I need to major refactoing, this seemed like the right idea but now running into all these issues,
