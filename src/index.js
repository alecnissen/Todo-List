// add the event listener module

// import "src/eventListenerModule.js";

import "./eventListenerModule";

import "./domLogic";

import "./conditionalLogic";

import "./arrayStorage";

// import "./style.scss";

// check array and local storage,

// local storage and array seems to be working fine, it is adding onto the current selections,

// I think next would be to add an event listener to the project names, to begin adding to-do's to projects

// ok so looking at the project for inspiration, 

// project names are added to the projects section 

// saved to an array and storage, 

// then if the project names are clicked, they are displayed in the main content section, 

// then once added to the main content section, user should be able to click a add btn or a trash btn, 

// add btn will make a form for todos to be added, then once added those todos will be displayed, 

// delete btn will permanately delete the todo/task. 

// how to prevent dynamically created element JS elements from forming when function is called? 

// fix up current code to use modules, move to own function 

// seperating the code is not working, can't add an event listener there, 

// I want to use the same logic I had before but to split the logic up into different modules, 

// take the div element 

// when you click on a project name, that project name should appear in the main section (fine) 

// It should also add the add todo btn along with cancel btn 



// work on fixing the btn issue, creating multiple elements on btn click, 

// if the user value is empty disable the btn or hide it, 

// I have tried both methods with no luck, 

// I was working with someone yesterday, and it seemed like the right method, 

// but I am very confused on why it is not working, I would think placing it before the function call would do the trick, 

// I will experiement with where the code is placed. 


// figuring out the logic for the buttons, user should be able to add multiple projects, 

// one project at a time, if user enters nothing, disable btn, 

// if something changes in the input field, re-enable the btn  

// I am having trouble logging the statement within the input listener, 

// practice in seperate file, I was somehow able to get it to work yesterday, 

// practice in a seperate, if no luck move onto generating the input field based on when user 

// presses the todo btn. 

// spend the rest of the time, trying to figure out an input form, 

// so with the pop-up field, don't forget to use the same logic as last time with didabling btn at the correct moment 
// once btn is clicked have the same pop-up field as you did with libary, 

// you will probably need a container then a div that's appended to it with the actual content, 

// container absolute, div is relative 

// then you will need an input for name, 

// due date, notes can use text area and description, 

// find a way to append to main project section, you can delete it, or choose to add more todos 

// that go with the specific project.  




// get familar with the functionality of the app . 

// the add project btn is now working, 

// now you need to consider how your project names are going to be added to the main content section 

// the names are added to the projects section, 

// once clicked they shall be added to the main content container, 

// if you click on the project name in the main content section, the to do form should pop-up, 

// remember one input form at a time, you may have to disable the btn and re-enable the btn, 

// before moving on I would also check, and review your current code, remove commented out code that does nothing but take up space \

// check the names of the variables and functions, make sure it makes sense to you, better to do it now, check it out 

// partially have the logic, that generates input field, 

// try to seperate the logic, grab this element projectNameElementProjectSection 

// grab the element add a listener to it, perform the conditional logic inside there, 

// then call the DOM module to begin adding it's properties.  

// hello everyone, running into a small problem with to do, 

// overall trying to keep my DOM logic and event listeners in seperate modules 

// I am trying to access the project name element from the DOM module 

// I am exporting the function that contains the variable, 

// then importing it but when I try to access the element in the listener module, 

// using ID, class, query selector, I jsut get undefined back, 

// I'm really not sure why this is happening, I have not ran into this issue yet, 

// importing and exporting and using functions/variables from other modules seemed very straightforward,
