// OK today the goal is to figure out, how to disable/exit the modal, and how to activate it 

// based upon a button click, 

// then once those are good, then we can focus on the styling of the modal, 

// first let's add the logic that can exit the modal, 

// grab the id or class from HTML, and first log the element correctly, 

// then add event listener, that sets the modals display to none, 

// then if the user pressed the + icon, set the display to flex, 









// projectDisplayConditionalLogic(); 




// so now we figured out how to prevent the user from adding more projects, 

// bascically clear the DOM, then add projects, 

// now add the logic, that will generate a modal, for the user to create a todo, 

// first I would just try it within the function, then maybe see if you can split the code up a bit, 

// print a simple message within the event listener first, 

// ok works good, now start constructing your modal, follow along with the article, or video, 

// needs title, priority, due date, description, 

// those values are then added to the todo array within that specific project, 










// So I need to reconsider my approach, instead of having storage reflect what is in the DOM, 

// DOM and storage are seperate, when a project name is created, save to storage but you also have project's array, 

// and whatever is inside projects array needs to be appended to the DOM, in the correct format, you may have to parse or stringify the data to work, 

// reflect whatever is in the projects array to the DOM. 







// function printProjectNameToNavbarProjectSection() { 
//      console.log("Hey this works");
//    }
   


// -- one issue I notice is that if I add a project name, I have to refresh for it to get it too show. !!!


// what I want to do next is to take the values/project names that are in local storage, 
// and append those to the DOM, 
// first just try to grab the elemnent and append value within the function, then work from there, 



// OK I am able to do it within the function 

// now try to seperate it, put that logic within the DOM Module, then once you get that working, style within seperate sheet, 






// projectArray.push(parseData);




// const someArray = [ {a: 1}, {b: 2}, {c: 3} ];
// const newArray = [ ];
// for (const blah in someArray) {
//   console.log(blah)
//   newArray.push(blah);
// };

// const someArray = [ {a: 1}, {b: 2}, {c: 3} ];
// const newArray = [ ];
// for (const project in someArray) {
//   console.log(project); 
//   newArray.push(project);
// };    



// this
// const someArray = [ {a: 1}, {b: 2}, {c: 3} ];
// const newArray = [ ];
// for (const index in someArray) {
// //   console.log(index);
// let x = Object.values(someArray);

// // console.log(x);

//   newArray.push(x);

//   console.log(newArray);
// };






// I will next write a function within DOM logic, that will get the local storage, grab the project names, then print them to the DOM, with in the projects section, 

// then if user clicks the project name, attach a listener, then within listener logic append project to the DOM, in both places 

// you will need to clear main content to make way for the new content, using replace child, 

// you need to make sure to convert the obj to a string, make sure it's in the proper format before appending, 

// if just needs to be the straight project name, 

// so once clicked populate with two buttons, delete, and add btn, if add btn is clicked, generate form which will save data and add to todo's within local storage, 

// append those todo's to the DOM as they are added, and remove if they are deleted. 









// projectArray.clear(); 


// I am running into some problems, on storage with todo list, my data is being stored correctly,  

// but I am noticing my project names are keep getting nested inside multiple array's, currently 

// project names are are made into objects then objects are passed to array for storage, once the page reloads, 

// I parse through the data in storage, and push the data back into the array, so the data is saved, 

// like I said, array's are being nested within multiple levels and I'm not sure why. 

// picture attached and some snippets of my code attached for context, I can also attach my repo if that helps to further debug this, 






// I think I can just put the array within storage and within DOM logic 

// I can pass the project object to the 


// read back over messages to determine game-plan, 

// properly store the data, objects are stored within an array, the array is being overwritten each time, 

// put those items that were added to local storage back into the array, so the array can keep those values, 

// keep the values in storage, values are being overwritten each time, 

// keep the contents of the array and local storage, 

// objects are stored within an array, get the project name object, add to local storage, get the value from local storage, and pass back into array?? 

// now seems like storage data is being overwritten, it's not updating, and not keeping data, 




// an array that stores objects, 

// factory function will make the project name title, give it an ID, and todo's / todo's will be an array, 

// have a global array, 

// double check your factory function, 

// factory must make, a name of project, id,, todo's in an array, 


// have the project names in an array and pass the array to local storage, so the values don't get overridden each time. 

// get an item from local storage, turn it into an obj using a factory function, 

// I want to make sure I am properly storing my data, both in the array the global array 

// and within local storage, if user enters info, it should save both of those values, 

// currently I can add values and I am putting name objects within an array 

// but it is overwritting each time and not saving the data, 

// store the array every time setItem is called 











// import "./style.scss"; 


// should I keep my event listeners in a seperate module? 

// lets test by importing and exporting, 

// Ok input is cleared, now I need to focus on getting the value and passing it to storage. 

// get the value, log the value, save to some type of data structure, 

// 


// OK so I'm sorta on the right track here, I am gettingthe user value, and passing it a local storage function, 

// I need one function to set the item, the project name 

// another function to get the project name, 

// maybe another function to get all the added todo's of the project, 

// and I believe you need to use obj's instead of array's 

// because the key of the obj === project name, the value/s of the project === the todo's ??? 



// first lets fix our storage functions to use one set and one get function, 

// well I'm confused on setting and getting items, I tried to make a seperate function but it did not work, 

// one function should set the item, the other function should retrieve the item/project name from local storage, 

// then once the project is retrieved, create logic that allows the user to add todo's, title, description, priority, due date, 


// make the project name an obj, 

// how will I store my data? How can I correctly store my data? 

// look over old posts to gameplan,  


// How can I properly store the projects name in todo, 

// once stored write a function which displays the contents of the storage, to the DOM. 

// what type of data will my projects be? I think obj's, key is project name, it's todo's are the values, 

// work on changing the project's name to an obj, instead of an array 

// how can I add items to an obj? 

// can I just pass the arr to a factory function which will create a project name obj, key is name value/s are the todo's

// I want to properly store project names into local storage, I am running into a problem that I want to make a project name obj, 

// then pass that obj to local storage, I am just having trouble, with my factory function, 









// check array and local storage,

// local storage and array seems to be working fine, it is adding onto the current selections,

// I think next would be to add an event listener to the project names, to begin adding to-do's to projects

// ok so looking at the project for inspiration, 

// project names are added to the projects section 

// saved to an array and storage, 

// then if the project names are clicked, they are displayed in the main content section, 

// then once added to the main content section, user should be able to click a add btn or a trash btn, 

// add btn will make a form for todos to be added, then once added those todos will be displayed, 

// delete btn will permanately delete the todo/task. 

// how to prevent dynamically created element JS elements from forming when function is called? 

// fix up current code to use modules, move to own function 

// seperating the code is not working, can't add an event listener there, 

// I want to use the same logic I had before but to split the logic up into different modules, 

// take the div element 

// when you click on a project name, that project name should appear in the main section (fine) 

// It should also add the add todo btn along with cancel btn 



// work on fixing the btn issue, creating multiple elements on btn click, 

// if the user value is empty disable the btn or hide it, 

// I have tried both methods with no luck, 

// I was working with someone yesterday, and it seemed like the right method, 

// but I am very confused on why it is not working, I would think placing it before the function call would do the trick, 

// I will experiement with where the code is placed. 


// figuring out the logic for the buttons, user should be able to add multiple projects, 

// one project at a time, if user enters nothing, disable btn, 

// if something changes in the input field, re-enable the btn  

// I am having trouble logging the statement within the input listener, 

// practice in seperate file, I was somehow able to get it to work yesterday, 

// practice in a seperate, if no luck move onto generating the input field based on when user 

// presses the todo btn. 

// spend the rest of the time, trying to figure out an input form, 

// so with the pop-up field, don't forget to use the same logic as last time with didabling btn at the correct moment 
// once btn is clicked have the same pop-up field as you did with libary, 

// you will probably need a container then a div that's appended to it with the actual content, 

// container absolute, div is relative 

// then you will need an input for name, 

// due date, notes can use text area and description, 

// find a way to append to main project section, you can delete it, or choose to add more todos 

// that go with the specific project.  




// get familar with the functionality of the app . 

// the add project btn is now working, 

// now you need to consider how your project names are going to be added to the main content section 

// the names are added to the projects section, 

// once clicked they shall be added to the main content container, 

// if you click on the project name in the main content section, the to do form should pop-up, 

// remember one input form at a time, you may have to disable the btn and re-enable the btn, 

// before moving on I would also check, and review your current code, remove commented out code that does nothing but take up space \

// check the names of the variables and functions, make sure it makes sense to you, better to do it now, check it out 

// partially have the logic, that generates input field, 

// try to seperate the logic, grab this element projectNameElementProjectSection 

// grab the element add a listener to it, perform the conditional logic inside there, 

// then call the DOM module to begin adding it's properties.  

// hello everyone, running into a small problem with to do, 

// overall trying to keep my DOM logic and event listeners in seperate modules 

// I am trying to access the project name element from the DOM module 

// I am exporting the function that contains the variable, 

// then importing it but when I try to access the element in the listener module, 

// using ID, class, query selector, I jsut get undefined back, 

// I'm really not sure why this is happening, I have not ran into this issue yet, 

// importing and exporting and using functions/variables from other modules seemed very straightforward, 

// I would just work on the function in the meantime, keeping everything within the same file, 

// work on issue on clicking project name in projects section 

// it should not append multiple btns. 

// that will cause issues 

// well thinking generally, similar to the previous issue, 

// I need to somehow disable the btn/name of the element, after it has been clicked 

// so the user cannot add another btn, 

// prevent the user from adding another btn, after clicking the btn, 

// If the user value matches what is already in the main content section 


// first work on the btn appending issue, if the user clicks the project name again, 

// it will keep adding btn's, don't add more btn's 

// don't add the project again, if it already EXISTS IN THE MAIN CONTAINER 

// NOW TOGGLING BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN TWO PROJECTS 

// YOU ARE SIMPLYING REPLACING THE PROJECT WITHIN THE CONTAINER, 

// ONLY ONE PROJECT CAN BE SHOWN IN THE CONTAINER, 

// the conditional to stop appending multiple projet's to the main content section, 

// the conditional will check if that project element already exists in the main content section, 


// the problem seems to be the buttons appending, I need to find a way to prevent the btn's from keeping on appending, 

// if the btn already exists the main container, then don't append, or disable, hide, or remove element 

// I am running into some many problems with to do list, 

// I am trying to keep things in modules and keep the logic/event listeners seperate from the DOM Logic, 

// I want access to the project name element within the event listener, 

// so if the user clicks the project in the little sidebar it gets appended to the DOM, 

// well right now I am performing DOM stuff with event listeners, 

// but that element is only available when the btn is clicked, 

// I guess my question is can I keep my current logic, within my DOM module? 

// The problem is that I want to access a particular but that element is created within a listener, 

// basically the user enters name of project presses add btn, the value gets passed to a function which creates the DOM element 

// such as appending to the projects section and the main content section, 



// Running into a lot of problems with to do 

// basically I want to access an element in a different module 

// problem is that element is dynamically created within an event listener, 

// I would like to keep my DOM and logic stuff seperate, 

// currently I grabbed the element in the DOM module, and added an event listener to it, 

// now I have to use logic, to make sure the user cannot keep adding the same btn to the DOM based on btn click, 

// basically my question is my current domLogic module ok? Adding an event listener and logic within the dom module 

// It does not seem right but I don't see any other way to do this. 

// how can I stop the add -todo btns from appending upon each button click? 

// everything is attached within event listeners, 

// click add project btn form is generated, add btn is pressed value is saved 

// that value is passed to another function, well the function is called then, 

// can we call the function at a different time, why? 

// shouldnt it be passed and called as soon as you get value? 

// can I just create another function, 

// one that stores the user value, 

// one that returns the user value appended to the DOM? 

// you pass the value to another function, 

// that function returns that userValue appended to the DOM/containers 

// capture it;s return value from another function, 

// add an event listener to that function, 

// so lets try to make another function 1 that takes the value and appends to container, DOM 

// I will now try to add the calender option to my todo form 

// another which takes that function above and adds a listener to it, using the logic inside . 

// expierment working with two functions, saving one function to variable, adding the DOM stuff return a value, 

// take that function expression add a listener to it. 

// well the problem is that every time I click the add project btn 

// it will keep appending more add-todo btns to the DOM, 

// because when the form pops up 

// and the user hits the add btn, 

// the function that handles DOM is called, 

// is there a way I can isolate the project section name element? 

// well what I was thinking of yesterday, 

// is can I make a seperate function? 

// can that function store a variable? userValue? 

// then can that function be called? 

// I'm not even sure what the hell to even do 

// that function is being called within the listener, 

// so every time you click that btn or project name, it will keep making btns 

// determine when it's time to append to the DOM ?

// one function to store value 

// one function to take/access that value and then append to DOM 

// store the value, the function can be called there, 

// then
